# Customer Banking

## Overview
Customer Banking was developed as an assignment from University of Denver's Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp.  The assignment was to create a customer banking system for savings and CD accounts that allows users to calculate and track interest. 

## Description
Four python codes are used to achieve the customer banking system and demonstrates modular programming learned in Module 3. The four codes utilized are as follows:
  - customer_banking.py - This is the main python code prompts the user to enter their savings and CD balances, interest rate, and how long they've had the account, which is used to calculate the interest by importing functions from savings_account.py and cd_account.py.
  - savings_account.py - This python code imports the Account class from Account.py and has a main function called create_savings_account which creates a savings account instance, calculates the interest earned based on user input, and updates and returns the account balance with interest earned.
  - cd_account.py - This python code imports the Account class from Account.py and has a main function called create_cd_account which creates a CD account instance, calculates the interest earned based on user input, and updates and returns the account balance with interest earned.
  - Account.py - Account.py creates the Account class and allows the user to set balances and interest in Account instances.
